Random Google Ponies
================

[![Preview](preview.png)](preview.png)

A Google theme that replaces the Google logo with a random MLP (My Little Pony) themed version.

You can find the gallery of all the logos used at [googleponies.cyberpon3.net](https://googleponies.cyberpon3.net/) as well as generating a style from a customized list of logos.

Current logos thanks to  ssumppg, ThePatrollPL, ViperDash, and Owl-Parchment

## Installation

First, you will need to get a browser extension that supports UserCSS. I recommend [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus):
- [Stylus for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
- [Stylus for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
- [Stylus for Opera](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/stylus/)
- Stylus for Edge - use the Google Chrome version above

Then just [click here to install the style](https://styles.cp3.es/furb-vote-icons.user.css)
